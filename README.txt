- Put item textures in item_sheet_compiler\item_textures\
- Run ItemSheetCompiler.bat

- Change the X and Y resolution of the exported sheet with the top button and the button below it respectively.
- Change the resolution of imported textures with the button below those two. 16 is default, but if your pack is higher or lower res, change that to match.

- Click compile to turn the textures into an item sheet
- Edit the item sheet png however you like
- Click decompile to turn the item sheet png back to individual textures

NOTE: You'll need to have the latest version of java installed.
